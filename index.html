# Demystifying the 3D Web
## Pietro Grandi

---

# Hi!
## Pietro Grandi
1. Frontend developer at BetssonGroup
2. Working with WebGL since 2012
3. Born as 3D Artist

---

# Why the web? 
## Web is everywhere
1. Desktop
2. Mobile 
3. Wearable

---

# Why the web?
## Browsers offer good environment for applications
1. Fast JS interpreter (V8)
2. Standards (HTML5, CSS3, Javascript)
3. One stack for several platforms

---

# Why WebGL?
## WebGL
1. Native API
2. Porting of OpenGL ES 2.0
3. GPU access
4. Khronos Group (independent consortium)

---

# Why WebGL?
## Native API
1. Access through JavaScript
2. No plugin required
3. Context from canvas

---

# Why WebGL?
## OpenGL
1. Industry standard
2. Shader based pipeline
3. Khronos Group (independent consortium)

---

# Why WebGL?
## Shaders
1. Define rules for visualization
2. VS for geometry
3. FG for projected pixels
4. Take parameters
5. Use GLSL 1.0

---

# Why WebGL?
## Shader pipeline
1. Link shaders
2. Load geometry data
3. Draw data

---

# Why WebGL?
## Immediate mode API
1. Scene is redrawn each time
2. No scene caching
3. Scene is managed by the application

---

# Why WebGL?
## Support
1. Chrome
2. Firefox
3. Edge
4. IE 11
5. IOS 8.0

---

## Yet another JS framework?!

---

# Why frameworks
## WebGL API offers primitives
1. Points and connections
2. Triangles and connections
3. Colors
4. Textures

---

# Why frameworks?
## World is bigger
1. Polygons
2. Solids
3. Fluids
4. Materials

---

# Why frameworks?
## A trivial example
1. webgl code for cube rotation
2. threejs code for cube rotation

---

# Which framework?
# The two bigs
1. ThreeJS
2. BabylonJS
3. OSGJS
4. SceneJS

---

# Which framework
## ThreeJS
1. Developed for Flash
2. Oldest and most famous
3. Community driven development
4. Tutorials and examples
5. MIT License

---

# Which framework
## BabylonJS
1. Developed for Silverlight
2. Supported by Microsoft
3. Includes physics support
4. Apache license 2.0

---

# Which framework
## OSGJS
1. Based on OpenSceneGraph
2. used by Sketchfab
3. MIT License

---

# Which framework
## SceneJS
1. Just rendering engine
2. Declarative approach
3. Used by BioDigital Human
4. Custom OSS License

---

# Not just 3D
## What about 2D?
1. Shaders can be used for 2D
3. GPU powered rendering
4. Filters
5. Texture blending

---

# Not just 3D
## PixiJS
1. Fast rendering engine
2. Support animations
3. WebGL blend and filters

---

# Case study
## Cool.
### Is someone REALLY using it?

---

# Case study
## Google maps
1. Big data visualization
2. Draw vectors instead of tiles
3. Custom framework

---

# Case study
## Autodesk
1. A360 Viewer
2. Revit WebGL Publisher
3. Using ThreeJS
4. Formerly using Flash

---

# Case study
## Unity
1. WebGL target as of 5.3
2. Compiles to JS (Emscripten)
3. Custom framework

---

# Security
## Have you read Microsoft's security report?

---

# Security
## Graphics driver and libraries are weak
1. Real time calls for performances
2. Less checks
3. Buffer overflow, illegal memory access, DOS

---

# Security
## Untrusted code
1. Web applications are not installed
2. Giving hardware access can be harmful
3. No control

---

# Security
## WebGL is not OpenGL
1. New allocated memory is zeored
2. Pixels outside framebuffer are set to (0,0,0,0)
3. Array buffers have fixed size
4. Only CORS validated resources can be loaded

---

# Security
## Denial of service
1. Malicious activity is detected by newer drivers
2. OS can reset the GPU
3. GL_ARB_robustness has been introduced
4. WebGL implementation could detect GPU reset
