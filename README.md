# Demystifying the 3D Web
## Talk @ Codemotion 2016
This is the presentation √ç'm using for the talks about the 3D web.
As every talk is slightly different from each other, due to time constraints and the audience, I'm going to add _tags_ on the _gh-pages_ branch to identify each talk.

Feel free to use it for your own talks, please provide also a reference to my work.

Thank you and happy 3D!

Pietro
