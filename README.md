# Demystifying the 3D Web
## Talk @ Codemotion 2016
This is the presentation √ç'm using for the talks about the 3D web.
As every talk is slightly different from each other, due to time constraints and the audience, I'm going to add _tags_ on the _gh-pages_ branch to identify each talk.

If you want to see it running, just go to [the pages](http://pietro909.github.io/demystifying-the-3d-web), otherwise clone the repo, type _bower install_ and _python -m SimpleHTTPServer_ or whatever you prefer to use.

Here you can find the code samples on [Codepen collection](http://codepen.io/collection/XGpQdO/).

Feel free to use it for your own talks, please provide also a reference to my work.

Thank you and happy 3D!

Pietro
